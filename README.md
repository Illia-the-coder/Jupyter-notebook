# 📷 Emotion Recognition on Video Thumbnails

This code performs emotion recognition on a set of video thumbnail images from the official YouTube channel of [Zelenskyi](https://www.youtube.com/@Zelenskyy_President) using a pre-trained VGG-16 convolutional neural network. It then creates several visualizations of the results.

## 🎓Usage

To use this code, you need to have the necessary data files and dependencies installed. The full code and documentation can be found in the **Jupyter Notebook file**.
